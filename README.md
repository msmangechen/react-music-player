### Introduction
Used React to build `Music Player`ï¼Œ`SPA` to play music with two parts. There is one part of muisc playing, and the other is for list of managing musics.
Used `react-hot` to update with `html-webpack-plugin` 
Used `PubSubJS` instead of `Redux`, so we can use `Pubsub.subscribe()` to operate `action`
